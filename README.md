[MLJ](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl) is a Julia framework for
combining and tuning machine learning models. MLJFlow is a package that extends
the MLJ capabilities to use [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) as a backend for
model tracking and experiment management. To be specific, MLJFlow provides a
close to zero-preparation to use MLflow with MLJ; by the usage of function
extensions that automate the MLflow cycle (create experiment, create run, log
metrics, log parameters, log artifacts, etc.).

## Background

This project is part of the GSoC 2023 program. The proposal description can be
found [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/iRxuzeGJ).
The entire workload is divided into three different repositories:
[MLJ.jl](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl),
[MLFlowClient.jl](https://github.com/JuliaAI/MLFlowClient.jl) and this one.

## Features

- [x] MLflow cycle automation (create experiment, create run, log metrics, log parameters,
      log artifacts, etc.)

- [x] Provides a wrapper `Logger` for MLFlowClient.jl clients and associated
      metadata; instances of this type are valid "loggers", which can be passed to MLJ
      functions supporting the `logger` keyword argument.

- [x] Provides MLflow integration with MLJ's `evaluate!`/`evaluate` method (model
      **performance evaluation**)

- [x] Extends MLJ's `MLJ.save` method, to save trained machines as retrievable MLflow
      client artifacts

- [x] Provides MLflow integration with MLJ's `TunedModel` wrapper (to log **hyper-parameter
      tuning** workflows)

- [ ] Provides MLflow integration with MLJ's `IteratedModel` wrapper (to log **controlled
      iteration** of tree gradient boosters, neural networks, and other iterative models)

- [x] Plays well with **composite models** (pipelines, stacks, etc.)


## Examples

### Logging a model performance evaluation

The example below assumes the user is familiar with basic MLflow concepts. We suppose an
MLflow API service is running on a local server, with address "http://127.0.0.1:5000". (In a
shell/console, run `mlflow server` to launch an mlflow service on a local server.)

Refer to the [MLflow documentation](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html) for
necessary background.

**Important.** For the examples that follow, we assume `MLJ`, `MLJDecisionTreeClassifier`
and `MLFlowClient` are in the user's active Julia package environment.

```julia
using MLJ # Requires MLJ.jl version 0.19.3 or higher
```

We first define a logger, providing the API address of our running MLflow
instance. The experiment name and artifact location are optional.

```julia
logger = MLJFlow.Logger(
    "http://127.0.0.1:5000/api";
    experiment_name="test",
    artifact_location="./mlj-test"
)
```

Next, grab some synthetic data and choose an MLJ model:

```julia
X, y = make_moons(100) # a table and a vector with 100 rows
DecisionTreeClassifier = @load DecisionTreeClassifier pkg=DecisionTree
model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=4)
```

Now we call `evaluate` as usual but provide the `logger` as a keyword argument:

```julia
evaluate(
    model,
    X,
    y,
    resampling=CV(nfolds=5),
    measures=[LogLoss(), Accuracy()],
    logger=logger,
)
```

Navigate to "http://127.0.0.1:5000" on your browser and select the "Experiment" matching
the name above ("MLJFlow test"). Select the single run displayed to see the logged results
of the performance evaluation.


### Logging outcomes of model tuning

Continuing with the previous example:

```julia
r = range(model, :max_depth, lower=1, upper=5)
tmodel = TunedModel(
    model,
    tuning=Grid(),
    range = r;
    resampling=CV(nfolds=9),
    measures=[LogLoss(), Accuracy()],
    logger=logger,
)

mach = machine(tmodel, X, y) |> fit!
```

Return to the browser page (refreshing if necessary) and you will find five more
performance evaluations logged, one for each value of `max_depth` evaluated in tuning.


### Saving and retrieving trained machines as MLflow artifacts

Let's train the model on all data and save the trained machine as an MLflow artifact:

```julia
mach = machine(model, X, y) |> fit!
run = MLJ.save(logger, mach)
```

Notice that in this case `MLJBase.save` returns a run (an instance of `Run` from
MLFlowClient.jl).

To retrieve the saved machine:

```julia
mach2 = MLJFlow.load(logger, run)
```

We can predict using the deserialized machine:

```julia
predict(mach2, X)
```

### Setting a global logger

Set `logger` as the global logging target by running `default_logger(logger)`. Then,
unless explicitly overridden, all loggable workflows will log to `logger`. In particular,
to *suppress* logging, you will need to specify `logger=nothing` in your calls.

So, for example, if we run the following setup

```julia
using MLJ

# using a new experiment name here:
logger = MLJFlow.Logger(
    "http://127.0.0.1:5000/api";
    experiment_name="test global logging",
    artifact_location="./mlj-test"
)

default_logger(logger)

X, y = make_moons(100) # a table and a vector with 100 rows
DecisionTreeClassifier = @load DecisionTreeClassifier pkg=DecisionTree
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
```

Then the following is automatically logged

```julia
evaluate(model, X, y)
```

But the following is *not* logged:


```julia
evaluate(model, X, y; logger=nothing)
```

To save a machine when a default logger is set, one can use the following syntax:

```julia
mach = machine(model, X, y) |> fit!
MLJ.save(mach)
```

Retrieve the saved machine as described earlier.
